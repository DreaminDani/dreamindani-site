A friend of mine just started as a [“UX Team of One”](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/the-user-experience-team-of-one/) (and Front-End Dev too!) at a startup. She asked me _nicely_ to put together a list of tools that I use(d) in a similar position at [my company](http://www.discuss.io).

Since it’s the end of the year, and the beginning of a new one, I figured I’d go through **all of the apps, websites, tools and services that I used/visited/depended on throughout 2017** and list them out for reference throughout the new year…
