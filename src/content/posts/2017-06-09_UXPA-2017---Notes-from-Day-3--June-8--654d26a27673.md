On the last day of the [User Experience Professional Association (UXPA) Conference](http://uxpa2017.org), I continued the deep-dive into UX that I desperately needed. After surrounding myself with the amazing talks and participating in engaging conversations, I am totally inspired. **In this post, I am happy to share with you my notes from the talks I attended.**

##  [User Interface Design Style Guides are Not Dead, they Just Smell Funny](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/sessions/user-interface-design-style-guides-are-not-dead-they-just-smell-funny/)

Presented by: [Michael Bechinie](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/speakers/michael-bechinie/)

> A User Interface Design Style Guide needs _its own_ project to survive

*   A user interface design style guide (UIDSG) doesn’t replace human-centered design activity. It is part of design management and provides a foundation for consistent, and more usable, user experiences.
*   Your UIDSG will _always_ be complete and can be improved through continuous iterations. **It is not a license to stop thinking.**
*   A UIDSG can be a single document, an interactive webpage or a wiki. These can be incorporated into production tools to make following the style guide the path of least resistance for development.
*   A good table of contents, search and meta-data (like version numbers, findings to support design decisions, etc.) make referencing a UIDSG useful and usable.
*   Developing a UIDSG and advocating its use by developers, analysts and test teams increases awareness towards consistency within the entire organization — this makes an interface’s usability as important as its utility.

##  [Show Some Emotion: Personality in UX Design](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/sessions/show-some-emotion-personality-in-ux-design/)

Presented by: [Ashley Pulli](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/speakers/ashley-pulli/) and [Morgan Knepper](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/speakers/morgan-knepper/)

> You should be trying to design a conversation with your users

*   A user experience’s personality can be defined by how it Looks (the visual system), Talks (the voice and tone) and Acts (motion).
*   Good design is appealing and a cohesive visual language establishes the way that your interface will be perceived.
*   Use interjections and other natural conversation elements to make it feel like your interface is talking with your users — even if you tend to have more formal or informational content.
*   Motion tells the story of the user interface and connects its visuals into an understandable “body language”
*   Personality is what attracts us to people and repels us from others. Establishing a personality more naturally connects users to what you are trying to convey.

##  [New Mobile App Heuristics: guidelines to quickly boost the user satisfaction of your app by 50%](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/sessions/new-mobile-app-heuristics-guidelines-to-quickly-boost-the-user-satisfaction-of-your-app-by-50/)

Presented by: [Jonathan Haber](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/speakers/jonathan-haber/)

> It’s okay to be a little bit different. As long as it’s usable.

*   Using [Neilsen’s heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), published in 1995, to evaluate present day (mobile) technologies is difficult and sometimes incomplete
*   We often assume that our user’s computer skills evolve over time and that they become more accustomed to complex interfaces and learned metaphors. This is a mistake. **Our users are less tech-savvy than we think.**
*   Use Neilsen’s heuristics, along with Robots and Pencils’ mobile heuristics (link not available) to evaluate and rank usability issues within a design.
*   Do not rush to change to a particular standard, guideline or design system — but still try to adopt new practices often. **These standards evolve over time** and we must develop our evaluative methods with them.
*   Establish heuristics within your UX organization by collecting usability problem’s across a variety of studies. Evaluate these problems frequently, coding them in grounded theory. If new patterns develop, incorporate them into your heuristics (and share them with the UX community)!

##  [Surviving your UX Career](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/sessions/surviving-your-ux-career/)

Presented by: [Jessamyn Miller](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/speakers/jessamyn-miller/)

> When conducting feedback sessions, be specific about what you want to get feedback on — don’t let others derail the conversation.

*   When you **don’t have enough time**, make time for your work by declining meetings, voicing your deadlines and prioritizing aggressively. Get things done by “time boxing” your work — no one will have pity on you if you miss a deadline “because \[you\] were in meetings”
*   When you’re **asked to do too much**, say “no” and protect your time. When your whole team is being asked to do too much, ask “what is really the top priority?”
*   **Low support** can come from lack of trust, lost relationships at work or an ever-changing boss. Ask for help, switch projects (or change companies) and find (or start) a club —_ create a safe place to try, fail and ask questions._
*   When receiving **negative feedback**, keep your cool, don’t make excuses and try to negotiate to make sure you are understood.
*   A **lack of influence** from UX in your organization can be fought by showcasing your work and better articulating your designs. _Power phrases_ like “For that reason…” and “This tested well/poorly” support your design decisions with logic. Phrases like “Do you agree?” and “Do your best” ask others to actively pursue solutions, rather than passively dismissing your designs/research.

##  Closing Keynote: Bringing Your Humanity to Work

Presented by: [Meena Kothandaraman](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/speakers/meena-kothandaraman/)

> \[Qual and Quant\] work in concert with each other

*   Human moments contain emotion, meaning , purpose and choice. **These make us people.** It is challenging to have these moments in the work place and in our user’s experiences.
*   Organizations have shifted away from humanity — human complexities are rarely considered or incorporated.
*   It is the responsibility of UX to refocus our organizations on moments of humanity — asking ourselves, “what moment can I focus on?” every day.
*   Organizations have shifted to number of all kinds but **we don’t need numbers for everything**. By trying hard to be efficient, we’ve lost the ability to feel.
*   UX can advocate for humanity if we:

1.  _Nail_ **_the basics_**
2.  _Challenge_ **_gratuitous practices_**
3.  _Understand_ **_the heart of the story_**
4.  _Embrace_ **_the emotions_**
5.  _Schedule_ **_reflection_** _to be part of the timeline_

##  That’s all folks!

I have learned so much in the short time that I attended this conference. These bullet points, quotes and slides cannot even come close to summing up the world of information that I absorbed this week.

I missed something important, summarized something wrong, or just want to start a relevant conversation… **feel free to leave a comment, below!**
