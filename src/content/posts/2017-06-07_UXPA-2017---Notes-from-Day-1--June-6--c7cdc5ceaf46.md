As inspired by Scott Berkun’s _[Min / Max Note Taking for Conferences](http://scottberkun.com/2014/min-max-note-taking/)_, I’d like to summarize a few key learnings from today’s excellent speakers at the [User Experience Professional Association (UXPA) Conference](http://uxpa2017.org) — currently taking place in Toronto, ON (June 5–8).

**In the sections below, you’ll find a 5-point summary of each talk, along with any pictures of slides or internet references that I found particularly useful.** I may come back and update this post, if the speakers decide to put their slides online.

##  [Opening Keynote — Creative Clarity: Finding Focus in the Midst of Ambiguity](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/sessions/opening-remarks-and-jon-kolko-keynote/)

Presented by: [Jon Kolko](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/speakers/jon-kolko/)

> Give your team a reason to go to work

*   Creative direction is less about doing the work and more about setting a trajectory for those who are.
*   Build trust within a team by holding group critiques and sharing artifacts.
*   Constraints enable creativity as they frame the problem and provide a basis from which you can measure and iterate.
*   Rules tell your team that “<this> is not okay.” They should be broken by all and the team lead should own the consequences.
*   Substantiate a problem’s framing with real data to explain _why_ we are doing the work that we’re doing.

##  [Experience Streams in Cross-Channel Service Design: Leveraging Stats and Insights](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/sessions/experience-streams-in-cross-channel-service-design-leveraging-stats-and-insights/)

Presented By: [Alberto Ferreira](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/speakers/alberto-ferreira/)

> Engagement = **mode** x context x need

*   Users navigate experiences in two modes:

1.  _Telic (or, as_ [_Levitin calls it_](https://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/0147516315)_, task-positive)_
2.  _Paratelic (AKA task-negative)_

*   These modes can be broken up further into:

1.  _Guided vs. Directed_
2.  _Motivated vs. Unmotivated_

*   Depending on the user’s affective state, they are more or less likely to make particular decisions.
*   These decisions can be mapped into a decision tree, where different affectors inform every decision.
*   User affection can be measured by affective mapping to Plutchik’s _Wheel of Emotions_ — asking the user (and groups of users) what emotion a particular experience makes them feel

## More info on this methodology can be found on a blog post by Ferreira, [“But how do you feel? The role of emotion in travel purchasing decisions”](https://www.tnooz.com/article/but-how-do-you-feel-the-role-of-emotion-in-travel-purchasing-decisions/)

##  [How we (sort of) made UX and agile work — A case study](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/sessions/how-we-sort-of-made-ux-and-agile-work-a-case-study/)

Presented by: [Yael Keren](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/speakers/yael-keren/)

> UX is a part of QA

*   UX needs to always be 1–2 sprints ahead of the development team(s) sprints
*   The UX team’s tasks during a given sprint can be broken up as follows:

1.  _Validating the previous sprint_
2.  _Designing for the next sprint_
3.  _Supporting and QAing the current sprint_

*   By grouping sprints in “Product Increments” (a la [SAFe](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/)), which is 3 “Sprints” + 1 “Planning Phase”, UX _and_ Development is given time to review the progress made in the last 6 weeks as well as reorganize.
*   **UX is a part of QA!** Convince the dev-team lead to dedicate _at least one developer_ for _at least one day_ to fix bugs and usability issues that were found within a given sprint, so that the release can be prepared with those problems accounted for and fixed.
*   Attend the development team’s standup/scrum/daily meeting and sit next to them, so that you can be available to answer questions. This will catch problems _early_ before they become a bug filed during QA.

##  [Experience mapping: Your roadmap to successful applications](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/sessions/experience-mapping-your-roadmap-to-successful-applications/)

Presented by: [Chris Hass](http://www.mycdevents.com/UXPA/speakers/chris-hass/) (Jim Williams could not make it)

> Everybody has a piece of the elephant, but nobody has the whole thing

*   As people become more and more connected to various channels of B2C/B2B interaction, the line between products and services are blurred.
*   A Journey Map can help explain the complete story of a particular user/customer/consumer/human within a given context
*   Good Journey Maps bridge the chasms between teams, by aiding them in:

1.  _Understanding and Communicating_
2.  _Identifying and Exploring_
3.  _Discussion and Prioritizing_

*   Insights from User Research provide the Goals, Needs, Behaviors, Motivations, and Passions of your Personas. These personas should be _light on ambiguous details and demographics_ and **heavy on behavior.**
*   Provide a map of the current experience and a map of the ideal. This will help codify your research, get everyone on the same page, and transition the conversation into designing solutions.

##  But wait… there’s more!

Tomorrow is another day, with much more learnings to come from it. I hope this post was helpful for reference (or learning, if you missed these talks)!
