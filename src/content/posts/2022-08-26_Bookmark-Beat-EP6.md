I took the week off of writing the beat, last week (remember when I said it'd be *mostly* weekly) ðŸ˜‰ [Did you miss me](https://open.spotify.com/track/7GSwmKxanoWEdpurOCldDe?si=263a6830c3fa4b7b)?

This week, I'm sharing tips on how to be a better advocate and assist Blind / Low-Vision folks. Plus, some practical guides, jokes and reflections on working cross-functionally!

### An intro: A delicious drink to end the summer

It's finally starting to cool down in Denver (where I live) and I've officially run out of the variety of whiskies I have in my bar. So I decided to try something new this week with the vodka that's been sitting in my freezer for months. This [Pear and Elderflower Collins](https://www.yummly.com/recipe/Pear-_-Elderflower-Collins-1986639) hit the spot!

It can be made with honey or simple syrup, but don't skimp on the liqueurs ðŸ˜‰ The combination of elderflower and pear gives a just-sweet-enough flavor to the otherwise pulpy puree. For those who don't enjoy alcohol, you can make the same thing with an [Escape](https://www.escapeliqueurs.com/non-alcoholic-elderflower-liqueur) "liqueur" and I'm sure it would be just as good!

Anyway...

### It's an astigmatism, not a stigma

[Last week](https://desandoval.net/posts/bookmark-beat-ep5/), I shared my experience as a low-vision gamer. Eventually, it's possible I'll go fully blind. This took a while to get used to... but what I found to be most difficult was to communicate to others what it's like to *lose vision*. The NYTimes' Video Series [Iâ€™m Going Blind. This Is What I Want You to See](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/opinion/blindness-retinitis-pigmentosa.html) is the closest I've seen to getting it right.

Similar to their Olympic coverage, earlier this year, [What It\'s Like To Ski Nearly Blind](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/sports/olympics/skiing-millie-knight-paralympics-fear.html), this article tries to simulate the world in a way that matches what so many folks see through their eyes.

As a designer with a foot in both the seeing and not-seeing world, I've been trying to figure out how to go beyond empathy (callback to 2020's "Empathy is Overrated" [blog-spree](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=design%20thinking%20%22empathy%20is%20overrated%22)) and spur action, creativity and inclusive practices instead.

This is how I encountered [Sighted Guiding](https://www.guidedogs.org.uk/how-you-can-help/sighted-guiding-training/) which, like CPR training or learning how to identify the signs of a heart attack, is a practical skill that can help you feel more comfortable around a blind or low-vision person. I hope that, even if folks never have to use these skills, these sorts of classes can help fully-sighted individuals understand what it takes to move this world with a different capacity for vision and maybe, *just maybe*, create a more inclusive environment for those around them.

### Speaking of inclusive environments...

What does it take to *make design crit work*Â¹? How does the *way we create documentation, mockups and expectations*Â² affect our relationship with the people who consume them? And how do we feel when all of our best intentions in these areas *fall apart*Â³?

May I present to you... the answers!
1. [Design critiques at Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-critiques-at-figma/) - a practical guide to making them work better
2. [Design files are aspirations](https://zeroheight.com/blog/design-files-are-aspirations/) - a reminder that even the best design system doesn't replace the need for clear communication
3. [George is surprised that the feature he wanted was not implemented the way he expected](https://festivus.dev/product-management/) - if you can't laugh, you'll at least cry (the [whole site](https://festivus.dev/) is gold!)

All of these point to the challenges of working in a balanced team of designers, engineers and product managers. This idea has been sold to us as a way to make working together a bit less "waterfall"...

At Spotify, they called it "Squads". At Pivotal Labs, we called it a "Balanced Team". What we found at Pivotal was that there's no "one size fits all" solution and just cramming together a PM, Designer and a bunch of Engineers wasn't going to magically fix everything. It took practice, feedback and *a lot* of retros for this structure to actually deliver on its promise...

The article, [Failed #SquadGoals](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/), does a great job of describing these common failures and the practices required to combat them. I highly recommend reading it slowly and not just skimming it to defend your own virtues. It's really good!

## Coda: Yet another link dump (YALD)

There's some things I found this week that wouldn't fit into my rambling narrative above, but I still want you to know about them:
- [Fresco](http://www.glimmir.com/) is a tool for mac that lets you choose a big picture and spread it across all your screens (my current desktop is the [Carina Nebula in 14k](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/031/01G77PKB8NKR7S8Z6HBXMYATGJ?news=true))
- [Choose wisely](https://blog.damato.design/posts/choose-wisely/) is a guide for how to choose the right "choice option" in a user interface
- [behind the scene of \'Animator Creating Animation\'](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/deekaymotion_behind-the-scene-of-animator-creating-animation-ugcPost-6964088572760965120-gyPj/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app) is an animation explaining how an animator made an animation (meta, I know)
- [Product Disrupt](https://productdisrupt.com/) is a curated list of resources to learn product design (oh dear, this might be even more meta)

Now let's get to the...

### ~~Tweet~~ Thread of the week

> My son has set the house up with a Pi-Hole. Itâ€™s a raspberry pi running Ad blocking on the whole houseâ€™s network. 
> 
> Weâ€™re a few hours in and weâ€™re seeing effects, as well as some teething problems.

Wow! Who knew a Pi-Hole could lead to such a rabbit hole!
