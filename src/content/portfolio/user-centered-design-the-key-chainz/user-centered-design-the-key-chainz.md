## About The Project

### Personal property is valuable

Maintaining access to personal property can cause frustration because users have inadequate tools for securing their belongings and protecting themselves reliably and affordably. As a result, our team is designing a home entry system that helps users achieve their goal of effortless security.

Our entry system consists of a keypad receiver and a key fob or mobile phone transmitters that can be use to unlock the deadbolt on a door hands free.

## Design Process

The Key Chainz utilized a user-centered design process to develop an Accessible Home Entry device

##### PRELIMINARY RESEARCH

Research findings were our first step in the design process. Through an in-depth literature review, we gathered information on creating secure access

##### IDEA GENERATION

We combined our individual design sketches and storyboards to generate a preliminary concept of our access system

##### DESIGN ITERATION

We developed wireframes and physical prototypes to present to users. With their evaluation and feedback, we made necessary changes to our product
