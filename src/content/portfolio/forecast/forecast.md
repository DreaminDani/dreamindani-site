The forecast program is a little project I worked on to see what I can do in an hour with access to an API or two. It was made for the class
[HCDE310: Interactive Systems Design & Technology](http://www.smunson.com/teaching/hcde310/a13/)

The program gets data from the “weather gods” by looking up an input location with the google maps api ([https://developers.google.com/maps/](https://developers.google.com/maps/)) and weather data with forecast.io ([https://developer.forecast.io/](https://developer.forecast.io/)).

Written using python2.7 (run with `python forecast.py`))

        print "The gods are sorry. That is not a valid answer."
