Between January-June 2014, I had the pleasure of participating in Kate Starbird’s Directed Research Group, [“Researching at the Intersection of Social Media and Disasters: Tracing the Spread of Misinformation after the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing”](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/research/archives#boston). Together, we used a series of qualitative techniques to generate actionable data regarding rumors in social media. Specifically, we targeted twitter users during the Boston Marathon.

#### During this project I…
- Assigned and assisted in the development of codes measuring the accuracy of various rumors
- Conducted statistical analyses of multivariate data, including qualitative and geospatial data types
- Created data-parsing python scripts to assist other researchers and fill-in holes in our data collection
