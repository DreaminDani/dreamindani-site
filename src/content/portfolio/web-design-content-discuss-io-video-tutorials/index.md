As the User Experience Designer at [Discuss.IO](https://discuss.io), it is my responsibility to reduce the amount of effort needed to learn how to use the market research interviewing application. To alleviate the pains of first-time users as well as give an overview of the various features that Discuss has to offer, I created a series of getting started videos.

You can find an archive of these videos here: [https://discussio.wistia.com/projects/7kzj7icq91](https://discussio.wistia.com/projects/7kzj7icq91)

These videos were originally displayed on this page:

I developed and designed the above webpage around the video content that I had generated. Hosting these videos on Wistia allowed for email collection after each video. I connected this functionality with our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, [Intercom.IO](https://intercom.io) so that we could monitor and reach out to our first time users.

The column to the right of the overview video contains a link to our first-time user guide â€“ a series of emails that I generated to give additional help (as well as a supportive incentive) in using our product.
